* The problem
  The problem we want to solve is to find a cut of a graph such that
  its weight is minimal. In other words, given a graph

  \[G = (V, E)\]

  where \[V = \{1,2,3,\dots,n\}\] is a set of \(n\) vertices and \[E \subseteq
  \{(u,v) \mid u,v \in V\}\] a set of \(|E| = m\) edges and a function

  \[ w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \]

  a /cost/ function, that returns the weight of each edge, we want to
  find

  \[p_1, p_2 \subseteq V \mid p_1 \cap p_2 = \emptyset \, , \, p_1 \cup p_2 = V\]

  such that

  \[\text{cost}(p_1, p_2) = \sum_{u \in p_1, v \in p_2} w((u,v))\]

  is minimized.

* Karger and Stein
  Karger and stein works by joining subsets of nodes, until only two
  remain. Those two are a cut of the graph. More in detail, given a
  Graph \(G = (V,E)\) where \(V = \{1,2,3,4,\dots,n\}\) is the set of
  vertices, the algorithm starts with a partition of \(V\) where each
  node appears by itself

  \[\{\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \dots \{n\}\}\]

  Then, let \(\mathcal{P}_a(V)\) be the set of partitions of \(V\), a
  =contraction= procedure joins two subsets and produces a new
  partition of \(V\).

  \[\text{contraction} : \mathcal{P}_a(V) \longrightarrow \mathcal{P}_a(V)\]

  This keeps happening, until the partition of \(V\) is made of only
  two sets \(p_1, p_2\). At this stage the sum of the weights that
  between the two nodes (the cut of the graph) is returned. This works
  because of the way in which the =contraction= procedure selects the
  nodes to join in the partitions. The two nodes are selected based on
  a random selection based on the weight of the nodes. Nodes with an
  higher weight have an higher probability of being selected.

  Doing such procedure, allows to find a minimum cut with probability
  \(\frac{1}{\log(n)}\), therefore by repeating this procedure
  \(O(\log^2(n))\) times we can find a minimum cut with error probability
  less than \(\frac{1}{n}\).

  Karger and Stein implemented as such has a complexity of
  
  \[O(n^2\log^3(n))\]
  
** Another bound
   Another bound for Karger and Stein is possible to achieve, if we
   consider that early contractions in the =contraction= procedure are
   much less likely to contract on the minimum cut.

   We call \(X_i\) the event that no edge of the minimum cut is
   contracted during the i-th iteration. We can define

   \[X = \sum_{i=0}^k X_i\]

   We know fron the analysis of the algorithm that by contracting to
   \(t = \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} + 1\) nodes the probability of contracting
   the minimum cut in this process is

   \[P(n) \geq \frac{1}{2}\]

   wich means the probability of success at the i=th iteration is at
   least \(\frac{1}{2}\)

   \[P(X_i = 1) \leq \frac{1}{2}\]
   
   We waht to find \(k\) such that our our random variable \(X\) (the
   sum of the /success/ of each iteration) does not go ``too far
   away'' from the mean value \(\mu\)

   \[\mu = E[X] = \sum_{i=0}^k E[X_i] = \frac{k}{2}\]

   since \(X_i\)s are indipendent random indicator variables.

   so we want to find

   \[P\left(\left|X-\mu\right| < \epsilon \mu\right) = 1 - P\left(\left|X-\mu\right| > \epsilon \mu\right) \]

   and we know by chernoff bound that

   \[P\left(\left| X - \mu \right| > \epsilon \mu\right) \leq 2e^{-\frac{\mu\epsilon^2}{3}} \quad \text{for } 0 < \epsilon \leq 1\]

   by replacing \(\mu = \frac{k}{2}\)
   
   \[P\left(\left| X - \frac{k}{2} \right| > \epsilon \frac{k}{2}\right) \leq 2e^{-\frac{\frac{k}{2}\epsilon^2}{3}} \quad \text{for } 0 < \epsilon \leq 1\]

   and therefore by choosing \(k = \frac{6}{\epsilon^2}\log(n) =
   O(\log(n))\) we have that

   \[P\left(\left| X - \mu \right| > \epsilon \mu\right) \leq \frac{2}{n} = O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\]

   and so
   
   \[P\left(\left|X-\mu\right| < \epsilon \mu\right) = 1 - O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\]
   
   therefore, for \(k = O\left(\log(n)\right)\) the algorithm gives
   a correct result with high probability with a complexity of

   \[O\left(n^2 \log^2(n)\right)\]

   The function plotted is the complexity of the algorithm. The
   coefficient for the surface (under which all results should fall)
   is calculated as

   \[\max \left( \frac{t}{n^2\log^2(n)} \right) \]

   since the time of execution of the algorithm is maximized by this
   function and the different coefficient depend also on external
   factors (CPU throttle, memory allocations, etc.) and we're
   interested the behavior of the algorithm against the input
   nodes. As we can see in Figure [[fig:kargerstein]] the run times follow
   the surface of the complexity function.

* Stoer and Wagner
  Stoer and Wagner works in another way. Instead of relying on random
  cuts relies on the fact that given a couple of nodes, They either
  are separated by the minimum cut or are on the same side of the
  cut. So given a graph \(G=(V,E)\), \(s,t \in V\), an \(s,t\) minimum
  cut is a cut \((S,T)\) of \(G\) s.t.

  \[s\in S \vee t\in T\]
  \[w(S,T) \text{ is minimum among all \(s,t\) cuts}\]

  So, let \((S,T)\) be a global min-cut for \(G\). For every pair
  \(s,t \in V\) either \(s\in S\) and \(t\in T\) or \(s\) and \(t\)
  are on the same side of the cut.

  Stoer and wagner leverages this fact and searches for \(s,t \in V\)
  s.t. \((S, T)\) is a global min cut for \(G\). If that's also a
  global min-cut its weight is returned, otherwise the global min-cut
  for \(G\backslash\{s,t\}\) (The same graph as \(G\), where the nodes
  \(s\) and \(t\) are merged together) is also a global min-cut for
  \(G\).

** On implementation
   <<impl>>
   In =stoer_wagner.py=, in the function =stMinCut=, around line 21 we
   can find
   #+begin_src python
     if v in q:
	 keys[v] = keys[v] + graph.weight(u, v)
	 q.update_elem(v, (keys[v], v))
   #+end_src
   =q= is an object of type =PriorityQueue= ([[../src/stoer_wagner.py::7][q = PriorityQueue()]]). The
   definition for this object can be found in the file
   =custom_queue.py=. The reason for using a custom version of a
   priority queue over the default =heapq= implementation of python
   are essentially 2:

   1. Allows to be syntactically closer to the algorithm definition we
      gave in class. The =PriorityQueue= object implements in fact a
      max-Heap structure where objects inside are tuples of type =(key,
      value)=, therefore in the implementation I don't have to rely on
      tricks such as decrementing keys instead of incrementing them to
      make a min-Heap (the default =heapq= in python) work like a
      max-Heap.
   2. Allows to update elements inside. the line displayed above shows
      =q.update_elem(v, (keys[v], v))= which is an internal function to
      update an element in the queue without removing ti ad adding it
      again, therefore resulting in a simpler and more concise
      definition of the =stMinCut= function.

   The =custom_queue= implementation was actually found online on
   [[https://github.com/denizetkar/priority-queue/blob/main/priority_queue.py][GitHub]][fn:1], and was originally used by the developer to implement
   the Dijkstra algorithm. I added the function =__contains__= in
   [[../src/custom_queue.py::41][=custom_queue.py=]] in order to be able to write =if v in q:= in
   [[../src/stoer_wagner.py::19][=stoer_wagner.py=]] at line 19.

** Results
   The complexity of this algorithm is

   \[O(mn \log(n))\]

   where \(n = |V|\) and \(m = |E|\). so the coefficient for the plot
   is calculated again as

   \[\max \left( \frac{t}{mn\log(n)} \right)\]

   [[../figs/Stoer and Wagner.png]]

   By plotting the run times against the input sizes (nodes and
   vertices) we can see that the plot follows the surface of the
   complexity function.

* Hybrid approach
  An Hybrid approach consist into merging the two approaches (Karger
  and Stein and Stoer and Wagner): the algorithm contracts the graph
  until there are \(t = \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}}+1\) nodes, from there, Stoer
  and Wagner is run on the contracted graph.

  To study the complexity we can take look at the hybrid procedure:
  #+begin_src python
    def hybrid(graph):
	n = graph.n_vertices
	# t = O(long(n))
	t = int(np.ceil((n / (n-1)) * np.log(n))
	amin = np.Inf
	d_time = 0
	for i in range(t):
	    cut, d_time = hybrid_iteration(graph)
	    if cut < amin:
		amin = cut
		d_time = perf_counter_ns()
	return amin, d_time
  #+end_src
  where the hybrid iteration is described as
  #+begin_src python
    def hybrid_iteration(graph):
	t = np.ceil(graph.n_vertices / np.sqrt(2) + 1)
	g = contract(graph, t)
	return stoer_wagner(g)
  #+end_src
  one =hybrid_iteration= consists in a contraction of the given graph,
  then from that contraction we run the Stoer and Wagner
  algorithm. Since the contraction is just a single loop running \(t =
  \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} + 1\) times, =contract(graph,t)= is
  \(O(n)\). Stoer and Wagner on the resulting graph is
  \(O(mn\log(n))\) by hypothesis.

  
** How many times run the iteration
   If we consider

   \[X_i = \text{the \(i\)-th iteration has contracted a minimum cuts'edge}\]

   we can have

   \[X = \sum_{i=0}^k X_i\]

   the sum of indipendent random variables that states how many times
   the random contraction have contracted the minimum cut of the
   graph. We know from hypothesis of Karger Stein algorithm, that

   \[P(X_i = 1) \leq \frac{1}{2}\]

   and by taking \(P(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{2}\) as assumption we can
   find an upper bound on the number of iterations needed in order to
   find w.h.p. the minimum cut. We know that, on \(k\) iterations

   \[\mu = E[X] = \sum_{i=0}^k E[X_i] = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{2} = \frac{k}{2} \]

   And we want to find \(k\) s.t.

   \[P\left(\frac{|\beta - \alpha|}{\alpha} > \epsilon \right) \leq O\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\]

   We can use the chernoff bound

   \[P\left(|X - \mu| > \mu \delta \right) \leq 2e^{-\frac{\mu \delta^2}{3}}\]

   that works for \(\delta \in (0,1]\) with \(\mu = \frac{k}{2}\). We
   conclude that, with \(k = \frac{4}{\epsilon^2}\log(n)\) we can
   say that

   \[2 e^{-\frac{k\epsilon^2}{4}} = \frac{2}{n} = O\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)\]

   So the same bound as for Karger and Stein applies, and the
   algorithm has complexity

   \[O\left(mn\log^2(n)\right)\]

   By plotting the run times against the input size (nodes and edges)
   we can see that they follow the surface induced by the complexity
   function of the algorithm.

* Conclusions

** On efficiency
   <<efficency>>
   By purely relying on the complexity analysis of the algorithms we
   should be able to see how the Karger and stein algorithm should
   perform worse than Stoer and Wagner and the Hybrid approach, which
   have instead comparable complexities. By plotting the run time of
   each algorithm:

   [[../figs/Runtime comp.png]]

   By looking closely to the graph we can see how the results meet our
   expectations: Karger and Stein perform generally worse than Stoer
   and Wagner, that performs in a similar way to our approach.

** On discovery time
   <<discovery>>
   Discovery time tells us another story. Even though Karger and Stein
   performs badly compare to the other two algorithms, the discovery
   time for the graphs in the dataset is not that worse compared to
   the discovery time of the hybrid algorithm. Stoer and Wagner
   outperforms the two even from this point of view, showing how is a
   generally faster algorithm.

** On running the script
   Every command from now on is intended to be run from the =proj=
   folder as =PWD=.

   One of the included file of the project is =requirements.txt=, it
   contains the dependencies for the project, and is intended to be
   give to pip in order to download and install them. Is also good
   practice to create a virtual environment to run the project, in
   order to avoid dependency conflicts with packages installed in the
   main system. To do so we can run in a shell
   #+begin_src shell
     python3 -m venv venv
   #+end_src
   A =venv= folder will be created, with scripts to activate the
   environment depending on the system shell. E.g. on bash on Linux
   #+begin_src shell
     . venv/bin/activate
   #+end_src
   or on windows shell
   #+begin_src bat
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   #+end_src
   or Power-Shell
   #+begin_src ps1
     venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   #+end_src

   With the environment active is possible to install all the required
   libraries (listed in =requirements.txt=)
   #+begin_src shell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   #+end_src

   From this point on a variety of scripts are available for the
   project. The main script is in the =main.py= file. can be run with
   #+begin_src shell
     python src/main.py --help
   #+end_src
   to show all the available options. Similarly =plot_d_times.py= and
   =plot_run_times.py= can be run in order to plot discovery times and
   run times of precedent runs.
** Structure
   Files in the =proj/src= folder are organized as follows:
   - ~graph.py~ :: contains the implementation of a class ~Grap~. It
     represents a graph, and internally consists on the adjacency
     matrix of the graph built starting by a list of nodes and
     edges. it implements methods useful for the algorithms (such as
     =merge_vertices()= and =cut_weight()=);
   - ~stoer_wagner.py~ :: contains the implementation of the Stoer and
     Wagner algorithm, along with all the functions seeded by the
     algorithm as subroutines (e.g. ~stMinCut~);
   - ~karger_stein.py~ :: contains the implementation of the Karger
     and Stein algorithm, along with all the functions seeded by the
     algorithm as subroutines (e.g. ~rec_contract~, ~contract~);
   - ~hybrid.py~ :: contains the hybrid approach implementation and
     all the auxiliary functions needed (e.g. ~hybrid_iteration~);
   - ~test.py~ :: contains the functions to test each single algorithm
     and a general ~mesure_run_time~ function to collect results of
     tests run in parallel on a given collection of inputs, in order
     to run multiple test in parallel and waste as little time as
     possible (each test runs on a dedicated processor, and does not
     exchange data with anything outside itself, therefore can return
     reliable time measurements). Each test is run only one time, since
     the computation of the min cut of each graph is long enough to
     have reliable data with just one run;
   - ~rapresentation.py~ :: contains functions to plot, print, read ad
     write csv files of data, relies on the common tuple
     rapresentation of a single run: ~(name, time, discovery time,
     #vertices, #edges, solution)~;
   - ~custom_queue.py~ :: contains the custom max heap implementation
     as described in [[impl]];
   - ~files.py~ :: contains and exports a simple list with all the
     files in the =dataset= folder written manually, ideally it could
     read the directory and return all the files in it but was out
     of the scope of this project;
   - ~file_parser.py~ :: contains a parser function that reads a file
     in the dataset and returns a graph based on its contents;
   - ~plot_*.py~ :: are scripts to plot the collected results.

** Collecting results
   Each run of a test function (=test_sw=, =test_ks=, =test_hy=)
   writes the partial results in a file, respectively =stoer_wagner=,
   =karger_stein= and =hybrid=, in order to use the data also
   later. The =plot_d_time.py= =plot_run_times.py= scripts read these
   files and produced the graphs found in this document for the
   discovery times and run times analysis ([[discovery]] and [[efficency]]).

** Given results
   Inside of the =project= folder, three files (=stoer_wagner=,
   =karger_stein= and =hybrid=) represent a run carried on the 15 oct
   2022, and contains the results collected to make this document. The
   following are the raw results, to show that each of the algorithms
   returns the same solution for each graph. Another script,
   =check-results.py= is also left in the repository in order to
   verify that each run of each algorithm returned the same min cut
   solution.
