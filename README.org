#+TITLE: Karger and Stein + Stoer and Wagner implementation

* Goal
The goal is to implement the Kerger and Stein and the Stoer and Wagner
algorithms to find solutions to the minimum cut problem in reasonable
time. The file ~main.py~ if run will run the two algorithms (for now
only the karger and stein is implemented) and output the found
solution, the instance size (number of nodes and edges) the time the
algorithm took and the discovery time (time from the start of the alg
in wich the min cut is found)
* DONE Kerger and stein
Works by contracting the graph repeatedly and recursively.
* DONE Stoer and wagner
Stoer and wagner also works
