#+TITLE: Karger and Stein + Stoer and Wagner implementation

* Goal
The goal is to implement the Kerger and Stein and the Stoer and Wagner
algorithms to find solutions to the minimum cut problem in reasonable
time. The file ~main.py~ if run will run the two algorithms (for now
only the karger and stein is implemented) and output the found
solution, the instance size (number of nodes and edges) the time the
algorithm took and the discovery time (time from the start of the alg
in wich the min cut is found)
* Activate the environment
  #+begin_src shell
    python3 -m venv venv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  #+end_src
* Run the script
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    python src/main.py --help
  #+END_SRC
  will expose all the available options (disable specific algorithms
  run, select specific files in the =dataset= folder, ...). By default
  all the algorithms (Karger and Stein, Stoer and Wagner and the
  hybrid approach) are run, the results collected in separate files
  and run times against input size are plotted. So usually what you
  eant to run is
  #+begin_src shell
    python src/main.py
  #+end_src
